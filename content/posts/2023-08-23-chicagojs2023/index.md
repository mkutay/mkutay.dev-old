Yesterday, I gave [a talk at the Chicago JavaScript Meetup Group](https://www.meetup.com/js-chi/events/288524156/). It's about Unicode, JavaScript, and the farmer emoji.

It's based on ["Why does '👩🏾‍🌾' have a length of 7 in JavaScript?"]({{< relref "posts/2023-05-26-javascript-string-lengths" >}}), a blog post I wrote in May 2023.
