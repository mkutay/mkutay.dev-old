Think of the most iconic Legend of Zelda dungeons. The Water Temple, Eagle's Tower, Arbiter's Grounds. None of these are actually called dungeons!

So when are they actually called dungeons? Here's what I could find in English:

- Link to the Past: [Castle Dungeon](https://zeldawiki.wiki/wiki/Castle_Dungeon) (only named in the credits)
- Link's Awakening: [Color Dungeon](https://zeldawiki.wiki/wiki/Color_Dungeon)
- Oracle of Ages: [Wing Dungeon](https://zeldawiki.wiki/wiki/Wing_Dungeon)
- Oracle of Ages: [Skull Dungeon](https://zeldawiki.wiki/wiki/Skull_Dungeon)
- Oracle of Ages: [Crown Dungeon](https://zeldawiki.wiki/wiki/Crown_Dungeon)
- Oracle of Seasons: [Gnarled Root Dungeon](https://zeldawiki.wiki/wiki/Gnarled_Root_Dungeon)
- Oracle of Seasons: [Dancing Dragon Dungeon](https://zeldawiki.wiki/wiki/Dancing_Dragon_Dungeon)
- Oracle of Seasons: [Sword & Shield Dungeon](https://zeldawiki.wiki/wiki/Sword_%26_Shield_Maze) (called the Sword & Shield Maze outside of North America)

That's itâ€”only 8 dungeons have "dungeon" in the name.

There's more to it than that, of course. Link to the Past uses the word "dungeon" in several places, even if it's not in the actual name of the location; in some cases, they go unnamed in the game but are named in supplementary material like the [Encyclopedia](https://zeldawiki.wiki/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Encyclopedia); other languages have different names for various dungeons.
