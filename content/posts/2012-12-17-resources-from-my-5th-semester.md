During my 5th semester, I produced some things that people might be able to use. Note that nothing here is guaranteed to be correct, though any inaccuracies are unintentional.

## Introduction to Statistics and Data Analysis (Stats 250)

- [Incomplete exam 1 study guide](/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Stats250exam1studyguide.html) - I started this with a friend of mine but we didn't finish it.

## Data Structures and Algorithms (EECS 281)

- [Exam 1 study guide](/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/eecs281exam1.txt), covering complexity (big-O notation and the like), some sorting algorithms, some C++ STL containers, searches
- [Final exam study guide](/uploads/school/eecs281_final/), made by me and several classmates ([PDF version](/uploads/school/eecs281_final/eecs281_final_study_guide.pdf), [Google Docs version](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yckyobmm251vll-lKJrNAba8SYnBCcKPSxU27QCh3-Q/edit))
- I wrote a number of [utility functions](/uploads/school/eecs281_cpp_utilities.cpp.txt) in C++ that I used in some projects, which you might be able to use. Most of them deal with strings (`split` and `trim`, for example). ([Mirror](https://gist.github.com/4366909))
- To study algorithms, I implemented some of them in CoffeeScript.
  - [Bubble sort](/uploads/school/eecs281_coffeescript_bubble_sort.coffee.txt) ([mirror](https://gist.github.com/3855313))
  - [Selection sort](/uploads/school/eecs281_coffeescript_selection_sort.coffee.txt) ([mirror](https://gist.github.com/3869977))
  - [Merge sort](/uploads/school/eecs281_coffeescript_merge_sort.coffee.txt) ([mirror](https://gist.github.com/3870128))
  - [Quicksort](/uploads/school/eecs281_coffeescript_quicksort.coffee.txt) ([mirror](https://gist.github.com/3874172))

## Introduction to Computer Organization (EECS 370)

- EECS 370's projects are mostly in C, and I found ["Essential C"](http://cslibrary.stanford.edu/101/EssentialC.pdf), a document put out by Stanford, to be incredibly helpful. Not a resource I made, but one that I found incredibly useful.
- I made a ["stuff to study" for the first exam](/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/EECS_370_exam_1.txt). Not exactly a study guide, but might be useful.
- My friends and I made [a study guide for the second exam](/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/EECS-370-exam-2-study-guide.txt)
- The whole class worked on [a collaborative study guide for the final exam](/uploads/school/eecs370_final/)&mdash;it even was endorsed by the professor! ([PDF version](/uploads/school/eecs370_final/eecs370_final_study_guide.pdf), [Google Docs version](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NPRMsU-5pi0gF0q5MXDzUwK-MUiexzRXgiafZITxU2w/edit))
- I made [a lil' page that converts between binary, hex, and decimal](https://evanhahn.com/tape/lil/base_convert.php).
- I made [another lil' page that does a bitwise nand](https://evanhahn.com/tape/lil/bitwise_nand.php) of two numbers.
