I'm Evan Hahn, a computer programmer.

I grew up in Silicon Valley and now live in Chicago.

I've worked for [Signal](https://signal.org/), the encrypted messenger app, and [Airtable](https://airtable.com), the low-code database product.

I maintain several open source projects. [Helmet.js](https://helmetjs.github.io/), a web security module, is the most popular with over 105 million downloads in 2022.

I wrote a [book about Express.js](https://www.manning.com/books/express-in-action?utm_source=express-in-action&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=book_hahn_express_4_7_16&a_aid=express-in-action&a_bid=fe3fcff7), a Node.js web framework.
